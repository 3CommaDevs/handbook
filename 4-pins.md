# Team Pins

We've started a small tradition here at Pinpoint where we celebrate a few milestones that we, as a team, get to experience together. These might be yearly anniversaries, a significant customer sale (or other fiscally-significant events), and/or team-centric celebrations.

Over time we should all have a handful of them to represent our time and our participation in the larger Pinpoint story.

#### Team Pin

This pin sports our official brand and logo. It comes in a few different colors (Black #121212, Dark Gray #484850, Yellow #ff9900, Light Blue #0099cc, Dark Blue #274656) and two different styles: A complete circle or a cut-out:

Every single person who joins our team officially will get one! Just let us know your style!

#### New Beginnings

This was actually one of the very first pins that we created and it represents "new beginnings," a blank terminal that captures all the hope that we have in an scary-exciting, unknown future. If you've joined the Pinpoint family in 2017 then you'll have one of these. Read a few more additional thoughts [via our blog post here](https://blog.pinpt.co/pinning-culture/).
