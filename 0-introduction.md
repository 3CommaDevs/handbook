## Mission Statement

We're building a platform that drives continuous improvement into a company's software delivery efforts. 

Consequently, our mission is simple: **Help companies build better software**.

## Our Values

Our values are simple and straight-forward, liberally taken from Jeff and Nolan's previous venture which worked out really well (see Axway acquisition [here](https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/17/axway-acquires-mobile-app-development-platform-appcelerator/)).

#### 1. Humility

Stay humble as there is always room to grow.

#### 2. Continuous Improvement

Measure, iterate, and execute. "You can't improve what you don't measure." - [Jeff](https://www.recode.net/2016/8/5/12377644/technology-startup-investment-advice-scale-slower)

#### 3. Customer Success

This value drives everything we do: Help our customer succeed.
