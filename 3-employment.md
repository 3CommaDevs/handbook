## Equal Opportunity Employment

PinPT INC is an Equal Opportunity Employer. The company supports diversity and inclusion in its core values and does not discriminate against qualified employees or applicants because of race, color, religion, gender identity, sex, sexual preference, sexual identity, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, marital status, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, military status, or any other characteristic protected by federal or state law or local ordinance. When necessary, the company will reasonably accommodate employees and applicants with disabilities if the person is otherwise qualified to safely perform all of the essential functions of the position.

## Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to community members and Pinpoint team members in all Pinpoint communities online (including but not limited to Slack, support chat, the Pinpoint Community Slack group, Twitter, Facebook, and other social networking services), in the Pinpoint office, and at all events hosted by Pinpoint.

Our community is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, color, sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age, disability (physical or mental), genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political affiliation as well as gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, computing experience, or clothing.

We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to the protected classes above, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstance.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Community members violating these rules may be sanctioned or removed from community spaces. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact [John](john@pinpt.co) or one of the other founders immediately.

## Drug and Alcohol Policy

Our priority at Pinpoint is to create a safe, comfortable, and productive environment for everyone we work with. We realize that drugs and alcohol can contribute to a culture of harassment or one that feels unsafe for some employees, even as it can foster camaraderie and friendship among others. Above all other considerations, our drug and alcohol policy is intended to preempt and avoid harassment and make work at Pinpoint feel safe. 

**It is the responsibility of every employee to ensure that their individual consumption is not making anyone else feel uncomfortable or unsafe.** 

Employees who violate this policy may face disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Alcohol in the form of beer or wine may occasionally be brought into the office to celebrate an accomplishment, birthday, or other milestone. Though events at the Pinpoint office will be presumed dry until otherwise discussed, there may also be events in the office after work where beer or wine are available.

Illegal drugs should not be used, bought, sold, or distributed while at work, either in the office or outside of the office while representing Pinpoint.

## Complaint Policy

Pinpoint is committed to creating a safe work environment that is free of threats to the health, safety, and wellbeing of the people who work here. That includes (but isn’t limited to) harassment, discrimination, violation of health and safety rules, and violence.

Pinpoint has an open-door policy, so employees are encouraged to report work-related concerns. If something about your job is bothering you, or if you have a question, concern, idea, or problem related to your work, please discuss it with the founder you report to as soon as possible. If for any reason you don’t feel comfortable discussing it with them, feel free to raise the issue with any other founder.

Any employee who witnesses or is subject to inappropriate conduct in the workplace can report it to [John](john@pinpt.co) or any of the Pinpoint founders. We encourage employees to come forward with any workplace complaint, even if it’s not about something that’s explicitly covered in our written policies.

Once a complaint has been made, the founders will meet and determine how to handle it. If one or more of the founders is the subject of the complaint, the remaining founder(s) will determine how to handle it. Any reports of a founder engaging in harassment or gross misconduct will trigger an outside investigator. With the employee’s permission, we will conduct a complete and impartial investigation, which may involve an outside investigator in serious cases. All complaints will be handled as confidentially as possible. When the investigation is complete, the company will take corrective action if appropriate. 

We will not engage in or allow retaliation against any employee who makes a good faith complaint or participates in an investigation. If you believe that you are being subjected to any kind of negative treatment because you made or were questioned about a complaint, report the conduct immediately to the founders.

Currently, Pinpoint is too small to have an internal group or department that can independently respond to complaints, so if the founders are named in complaints, they will do their best to hold one another accountable.  Where appropriate, the founders will engage a third party to conduct a thorough investigation and recommend corrective action, where necessary.



## Working Remotely

--- Currently we do not have a physical home office so the following does not currently apply... ---

If you're on the team right now it means we fully trust you to do a kickass job, regardless of where you are physically. :fire: :bomb: :thumbsup:

**DRAFT for the Future...**

#### Scope

This policy is written in the context of our current company setup, which is that every employee works in the same office for the most of the work week. Specifically, this document addresses working from home on a regular basis and/or working remotely for up to one week out of any given month. It does not address:

* A fully remote employee
* An employee who works from the office 1wk/month or is remote for the majority of their time
* A team that is distributed

If and when the current company setup changes, we should address the above situations. For the purpose of this document, we interpret remote work as as a co-located employee of Pinpoint working from home or from somewhere irregular. 

#### Approach

We treat working remotely as a privilege that comes with both benefits and costs.

The benefits are primarily ones of flexibility: As individuals, we are able to work when we want to and where we want to. This lets us do our best work and contribute to our team in a custom-crafted framework that lets us lead more fulfilling lives. The costs are primarily ones of communication: being out of the office means more base-line work and incidental complexity for all employees. More is required of both the remote employee and the employees in the office to keep in sync, collaborate, and own the work we do in a visible way. 

When we work remotely, it's our responsibility to accept the benefits graciously, and go above and beyond to not let the costs affect our work or the work of our teammates. A remote workday:

* is not shorter than a day at the office
* is not less productive
* is not an excuse for missing commitments (be they meetings or deadlines). 

Even when we aren't in the office, our teammates are still counting on us and it is our responsibility to make sure we are exceeding their expectations.

At the same time, it is the responsibility of workers in the office to reasonably accommodate remote workers. This means being willing to schedule meetings in light of timezone differences and to manage expectations around immediate feedback.  

The guidelines in this document (and the handbook at large) give us tools to make remote work easier, but tooling is only a small part of the solution. Every employee needs to complement these tools with extra work to make remote work effective for the employee working remotely and the rest of our team.

#### WFH Policies

The majority of policies that support remote work in Pinpoint apply to everyone at Pinpoint, not just remote workers. The primary documents that outline these policies are:

* [Effective Meetings](https://github.com/pinpt/handbook/blob/master/Operations-Docs/effective-meetings.md)
* [Communication and Transparency](https://github.com/pinpt/handbook/blob/master/Onboarding-Docs/communication-and-transparency.md)

#### Extended remote work 

***An extended remote work period includes anything longer than 2 days or any period of time where we work from somewhere irregular.***

If you're planning to work remotely for more than two consecutive days, or you're planning to work remotely from a place that's not your home (i.e. from a partner's home in a different city), you'll need to follow these additional guidelines. Even more than standard remote work, working remotely for an extended period of time is a privilege — it **will** require a large amount of extra work from you to make sure that the team is effective with you working remotely.

#### Get Approval From your manager

You need your manager's approval before you can work remotely for an extended period of time. This check-in should happen at least two weeks in advance, before you make any travel arrangements, and you should come prepared with a plan for how you will handle the logistics and extra communication work involved in extended remote work. In order for an employee to work remotely for an extended period of time, they should have demonstrated in the past that they are effective working remotely and upholding their quality of work. If that's not the case, the manager can and should veto the option.

#### Give the team heads up

You should give everyone on the team as much notice as possible, but at least 7 days. This will ensure everyone can plan their meetings and work accordingly. 

Always take the following steps to let the team know:

* Post in #office with a @channel tag so everyone sees the notification
* Communicate verbally with the people you work closest with
* Update your calendar to mark which days you are working remotely

#### Plan & Prepare Beforehand

It's your responsibility to both make sure you are effective and don't let your teammates down — regardless of the location you work from. This means that you should plan & prepare in your free time before you leave to work remotely. 

A non-exhaustive list of things to ensure are in order are:

* You will have a fast, consistent wi-fi connection
* You will have a distraction-free environment to work in
* You will have a quiet, private place to take phone calls and meetings
* You will be able to work a full workday every day you're working remotely

#### Co-working Space Subsidies

Working remotely can add a financial burden on an individual. At the same time, it is also a privilege. While Pinpoint is on its seed extension, Pinpoint will subsidize co-working space costs for up to $10/day. Once Pinpoint reaches profitability or raises its next major fundraising round, we will revisit this subsidy.

### Manager Retrospectives

#### Regular 1:1s

If an employee works remotely, they should make the topic of their remote work a regular part of weekly 1:1s. 

This is a time where employees can voice concerns about constraints that are limiting their ability to work effectively: this could be concerns about structures inside of Pinpoint that limit their flexibility, concerns about how the way other teammates work, or anything else that might affect how they work. It's also a time where managers should give concrete feedback on whether an employee is upholding their responsibilities when they are working remotely.

#### Dedicated Retrospectives

Before an employee works remotely for an extended period of time (defined below),  they should schedule a retrospective with their manager for when they get back.

This meeting is essential for debriefing what did and didn't work in the time they were gone and ensuring lessons learned are rolled back into the way we work at Pinpoint.

#### Loss of the privilege

Having the flexibility to work remotely is a privilege. If an employee's unable to uphold the responsibilities that go along with that privilege, their manager should work with them through their 1:1s and dedicated retrospectives to resolve the issue. If the employe cannot resolve the issue, their manager can revoke the privilege. 










## Employee Privacy

#### Workspace Privacy

As an employer, it is Pinpoint’s goal to monitor or track our employees in as few ways as possible. We want Pinpoint employees to feel a sense of ownership towards their personal workspaces and be comfortable at the office. However, in order to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Pinpoint employees, company property (e.g. desks, laptops, and other devices) is subject to search. For instance, this might be used if management learns that an employee has brought a gun to work or has stolen company property.

This means that while the company will always try to respect employee privacy, employees do not have a right to privacy in their workspaces in any property that belongs to Pinpoint. Pinpoint reserves the right to search company property at any time, without warning, to ensure compliance with our policies, including those that cover employee safety, workplace violence, harassment, theft, and possession of prohibited items. If you use a lock on any item of company property, you must give a copy of the key or combination to one of the founders.

#### Email and Internet Privacy

Pinpoint email and Internet are not being actively monitored by anyone, but because they are company resources that are managed according to company policy, you should not expect privacy from either. The company has both the ability and the right to look at employee usage for both in order to protect employee safety and wellbeing, as well as company property and interests.

#### Email Is Not Private

Email messages, including attachments, sent and received from a Pinpoint email address are the property of Pinpoint. We reserve the right to access, monitor, read, and/or copy email messages at any time, for any reason. You should not expect privacy for any email you send using your Pinpoint email, including messages that you consider to be personal or label with a designation such as “Personal” or “Private.”

#### Use of the Email System for Personal Email

The email system is intended for official Company business. If you send personal messages through the Company’s email system, you must exercise discretion as to the number and type of messages you send. You must also ensure that your personal use of the email system does not interfere in any way with your job duties or performance.

#### All Conduct Rules Apply to Email

All of our policies and rules of conduct apply to employee use of the email system. This means, for example, that you may not use the email system to send harassing or discriminatory messages, including messages with explicit sexual content or pornographic images; to send threatening messages; or to reveal company trade secrets.

#### Professional Tone and Content

We expect you to exercise discretion in using electronic communications equipment. When you send email using a Pinpoint email address or Pinpoint social account, you are representing Pinpoint. Make sure that your messages are professional and appropriate, in tone and content. Remember, although email or social media may seem like a private conversation, they can be printed, saved, and forwarded to unintended recipients. You should not send any email/message/update/etc. that you wouldn’t want our team, your family, or our competitors to read.

#### Email Security

To avoid email viruses, phishing for account information, and other threats, employees should not open email attachments from people and businesses they don’t recognize, particularly if the email appears to have been forwarded multiple times or has a nonexistent or peculiar subject heading. Even if you know the sender, do not open an email attachment that has a strange name or is not referenced in the body of the email; it may have been transmitted automatically, without the sender’s knowledge.

If you believe your computer has been infected by a virus, worm, or other security threat to Pinpoint’s system, you must inform the founders immediately.

Employees may not share their email passwords with anyone, including coworkers or family members. Revealing passwords to the Company’s email system could allow an outsider to attack the Pinpoint network

#### Internet Use Is Not Private

We reserve the right to monitor employee use of the Internet at any time. You should not expect that your use of the Internet—including but not limited to the sites you visit, the amount of time you spend online, and the communications you have—will be private.




## Salary and Equity Compensation

**TBD and UPDATED!! THIS IS NOT FINAL**

The following policy will apply to compensation offers for the first 10 employees at Pinpoint. After we have hired 10 people, we will likely revise the salary rubric and equity amount.

#### Salary

Fair compensation is critical to making Pinpoint a desirable place to work and helping our employees lead happy, healthy lives inside and outside of the office. When used as a motivational tool, though, it can incentivize the wrong kind of optimizations. Our goal with salary is that it checks the box of "enough" for folks who are excited about working at Pinpoint (because of the people, product, and opportunity for growth) and then fades into the background.

Traditional salary negotiations are also heavily biased because they rely on individual gut feelings and negotiation. This favors candidates who come from more privileged backgrounds and are afforded more confidence during the hiring process.

To avoid that bias, and to better align motivations, we have a standard rubric that determines all employee salaries. Everyone in the company falls into one of four options based on their job description and years of past experience as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Years Experience</td>
    <td>Technical</td>
    <td>Non-Technical</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>More than 5 Years Experience</td>
    <td>$XXXk</td>
    <td>$XXXk</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Less than 5 Years Experience</td>
    <td>$XXXk</td>
    <td>$XXXk</td>
  </tr>
</table>


We count experience as any time doing the same category of job at a company similar to Pinpoint (such that the experience is relevant to the job being offered at Pinpoint).

The offer also comes with the option to take $5k less salary in exchange for ~.1% more equity.

At the beginning of each year (in January), we will adjust this rubric to make sure it stays at market rate.

Note: The three Pinpoint founders' salaries do not follow this rubric and are all $0k per year.

#### Equity

Every employee will be offered XX,XXX Pinpoint stock options (~.XXX% of outstanding shares, including the option pool these are drawn from). As mentioned above, they can also choose to reduce their salary by $Xk/year in exchange for X,XXX more options (an additional ~.X%, totaling ~X% of outstanding shares).

These equity grants are larger than industry standard, but also vest over a longer period of time. Employee equity vests over 6 years with a 1 year cliff (while 4 years with a 1 year cliff is standard).

At Pinpoint, we’re hoping to build a team that stays with the company and grows with us, so offering larger ownership of the company over a greater period of time aligns with our goals. If employees leave Pinpoint before the 6 years, they will still own more of Pinpoint than if we offered less equity that vested more quickly, but the longer vesting schedule makes our goal more explicit in the initial offer.

All new employees should also check out our **Guide to Your Equity** below, which walks through the nuances of owning Pinpoint stock options.

## Guide to Your Equity

--- THIS IS NOT UPDATED YET... STAY TUNED... ---

There are currently **X,XXX,XXX** shares of Pinpoint common stock outstanding.

Our 409A Valuation Report, which discusses the price per share of employee shares, is available (to employees only) [here](http://). Any employee with questions about the report, our share price, or valuation should ask B.

**This guide is meant to help you understand the piece of Pinpoint that you’re going to own!** 

Its goal is to be more straightforward than the full Stock Incentive Plan and Award Agreement, which both go into the full legal details. You should consult an employment attorney if you have any questions about navigating your stock options and before you make important decisions.

Owning stock in Pinpoint gives you a stake in our success. As Pinpoint grows and increases in value, you will own a piece of that growth and increased value. Pinpoint is pretty small today, but if things go well, your stock could be worth many times more. However, you are gambling with this portion of your compensation -- if Pinpoint decreases in value, then your options won’t be worth anything.

#### Stock Options

At Pinpoint, we give equity grants in the form of Incentive Stock Options (ISOs). It’s called an option because you have the *option* to buy Pinpoint stock later at the same price it was worth when the option was granted. So if a share of Pinpoint stock is worth $1 today and we grow so it’s worth $20 in a few years, you’ll still be able to buy it for $1 (and then sell it immediately for a profit of $19).

The reason we give stock options instead of straight stock is that it keeps you from being taxed on the stock until you actually use it.

If we gave you $10,000 worth of Pinpoint stock today, you would have to pay thousands of dollars in taxes this year. If we give you options for $10,000 worth of stock, you don’t have to pay any taxes until you exercise them (more on exercising later).

#### Vesting

Instead of giving you all of your options on day one, you get them over time. This process is called vesting and different companies offer vesting schedules of different lengths. If you had a basic 2 year vesting period, you would own a quarter of your stock after 6 months, half of your stock after a year, and all of it after 2 years.

The industry standard right now is 4 years, but at Pinpoint, employees’ stock vests over 6 years. We offer much higher equity grants than the industry standard (about 2x in most cases), but it takes longer to earn them. This works out so that employees always come out ahead, even if they leave before their stock has fully vested, but helps us communicate that we’re looking for employees who want to build longer careers at Pinpoint.

Vesting happens on a monthly basis (so you vest 1/72 of your options each month), but many vesting schedules include a cliff.

A cliff is a period at the beginning of the vesting period where your equity does not vest monthly, but instead vests at the end. At most companies, including Pinpoint, this cliff happens at one year. This means that if you leave your job before you’ve worked for a whole year, none of your options will be vested. At the end of that year, you’ll vest the entire year’s worth of equity all at once. This helps keep the ownership of Pinpoint stock to folks who have worked at the company for a meaningful amount of time.

#### Dilution

When Pinpoint raises money from outside investors, it needs to create new stock to sell those investors. You will own the same number of shares as you did before, but there will be more total shares of Pinpoint available, so you will own a smaller percent of the company -- this is called dilution.

If we get a fair valuation for the company, then the value of your options stay the same when we raise outside money because the company’s new valuation will be equal to the old value of the company + the new capital raised. For example, if Pinpoint is worth $20m and we raise $5m, we are now worth $25m. If you owned 5% of $20m before, you now own 4% of $25m (we sold 20% of the company, or, said differently, diluted you by 20%). The 5% stake was worth $1m before the fundraise and the 4% stake is now worth $1m.

You can also be diluted as we give equity to employees. Pinpoint gives stock option grants to new employees out of an option pool, or a group of options that the Pinpoint board of directors creates all at once. This means that you will not be diluted each time we hire a new employee, but only when we need to create a new option pool. Pinpoint’s current option pool is intended to cover the first 10 hires (after the three founders) before it needs to be refreshed. For some high-level executive hires, the board might approve stock option grants outside of the equity pool. In both cases, the hope is that employees add more value to the company than the equity they receive.

Investor dilution won’t affect the value of your stock, but the valuation that we raise money at definitely will. Valuations (how much a company is worth) in private markets are highly unpredictable and subjective -- a share of Pinpoint stock is worth whatever someone will pay for it. Competition between investors, general market performance, perceived future value, and our negotiation skills all play into that valuation and the value of your options will be affected by those forces.

#### Exercising Your Options

"Exercising your options" means buying the stock guaranteed by your options. You pay the exercise price that was set when the options were first granted and you get stock certificates back. You can only exercise stock that has vested, but you can do it at any time by filling out a form and paying the cash amount for the stock.

You will usually only want to exercise the stock when you have the opportunity to sell it for a higher price than you are buying it for or when it is expiring.

Your stock options expire 10 years after they were issued. You have 7 years to exercise your options after you stop working at Pinpoint, but by law the options only count as ISOs for 90 days after you stop working. Once those 90 days are up, the options count as non-qualified stock options, so they count as income and are subject to income tax when you exercise them.

Traditionally, employers have made options expire quickly after employees stop working at the company because the company also has to pay tax on the options when they are non-qualified and considered income. However, this means that many cannot afford to exercise their options and so either a) leave the company and lose the equity they worked hard for or b) stay at the company until they can afford it (this situation is often referred to as "golden handcuffs"). At Pinpoint, we want our employees to keep the equity they earn, and we don't want to keep anyone working here if they're not happy, so we give employees the option to exercise their options up to 7 years after they leave Pinpoint.

However, there is a very significant increase in the tax burden of exercising options 90 days after leaving Pinpoint that we cannot control. This means that while you have more options regarding your equity, you will lose a significant amount of your options' value if you wait. In weighing your different options, you should consult a tax attorney to help decide what path makes the most sense for you.

#### Exercise Prices and 409a Valuations

The exercise price is how much Pinpoint stock was worth when you received the stock option grant. Figuring out the right number for this (one that keeps the IRS happy, but also helps make option grants valuable) is important. Investors in Pinpoint get *Preferred Stock* with some special privileges (more on that below) so we don’t want to use the same valuation they paid to price your Common Stock.

The lower the exercise price for Common Stock, the more money your options will earn you, so it’s in our best interest to make this price really low. Traditionally, companies would divide the Preferred Stock price by 10 or more and use that price, but the IRS decided that was unfair, so now private companies are required to undergo something called a 409a valuation to determine the exercise price of our stock. The valuation is good for a whole year or until we raise more money. (We are currently in the process of getting our 409A Valuation)

#### Taxes

**Tax law is complex and you should consult a tax attorney who is familiar with startup stock options before making any decisions.**

With Incentive Stock Options (ISOs), you aren’t taxed when you exercise your options, and the profit you make between the exercise price and the price you sell your stock for is taxed as capital gains (much lower than income tax). *However*, because you’re not paying income tax on this gain, this money is counted as a "tax preference" towards the [Alternative Minimum Tax](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Alternative-Minimum-Tax-%28AMT%29-Assistant-for-Individuals) limit.

This changes if you exercise stock less than 2 years after the grant was made because then the options are automatically treated as Non-qualified Stock Options (NSOs) instead of Incentive Stock Options (ISOs). NSOs are treated much less favorably under tax law because they can be given to people who don’t work at Pinpoint. This complicates the tax law and is beyond the current scope of this document.

#### Classes of Stock

When Pinpoint raises outside capital, investors will buy a form of Preferred Stock that gives them special rights on top of their ownership of the business. Each subsequent round of funding will create a new class of stock with its own rights -- these are usually named by the rounds of funding (ex. Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, etc.). Here are a few example rights that preferred stock may have.

**Board seats:** A class of Preferred Stock may elect, independent of the other shareholders, a certain number of board seats. For instance, the Series A Preferred Stock holders may be able to elect one person to Pinpoint’s board of directors.

**Liquidation preferences:** In a liquidation event (Pinpoint is sold or goes public), investors with liquidation preferences get paid back first. These favor the investor and lower the value of the stock. They usually cascade from the later rounds backwards, and can be a multiple of the money raised. For instance, if our Series A investors invested $5m with a 2x liquidation preference and Pinpoint was bought, then $10m would go back to the Series A investors before anyone else got any money back. If Pinpoint was sold for $10m or less, that would mean that everyone with common stock (founders and employees) would get nothing. If Pinpoint sold for $15m, then $5m would be distributed among the common stockholders.

#### Outstanding Convertible Notes

Pinpoint has raised $X,XXX,XXX to date, all as convertible notes.

A convertible note is a popular way for startups to raise money because it lets us delay picking a valuation for a company. Instead of selling equity for a fixed price, we borrow the money as debt. Then, next time we raise money, that debt converts to equity at a discount. The discount rewards the initial investors for investing in the company early, and usually comes in 2 forms: a discount and a cap.

The discount is a fixed percentage (20% for Pinpoint) that the investors will get when the debt is converted into equity. The cap is a maximum valuation that the first investors will have to pay for the stock.  The debt converts to stock at whichever is lower: 80% of the price of the next round or the valuation cap.

For Pinpoint’s fundraise:

$XXX,XXX was raised on notes with a cap of $5m

$X,XXX,XXX was raised on notes with a cap of $6m

Anyone is always welcome to ask Jeff, our CEO, any questions they have about their options, Pinpoint’s fundraising, or anything else related to equity at Pinpoint. However, everyone should also consult a lawyer before making important financial decisions, especially regarding their equity because there are complex legal and tax requirements that may apply.
