# Pinpoint Core Values

Our values are simple and straight-forward, liberally taken from Jeff and Nolan's previous venture which worked out really well.

## Humility

Stay humble as there is always room to grow.

## Continuous Improvement

Measure, iterate, and execute. "You can't improve what you don't measure." - [Jeff](https://www.recode.net/2016/8/5/12377644/technology-startup-investment-advice-scale-slower)

## Customer Success

This value drives everything we do: Help our customer succeed.
