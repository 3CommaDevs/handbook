# Pinpoint Core Values

Our values are simple and straight-forward, liberally taken from Jeff and Nolan's previous venture which worked out really well (see Axway acquisition [here](https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/17/axway-acquires-mobile-app-development-platform-appcelerator/)).

## 1. Humility

Stay humble as there is always room to grow.

## 2. Continuous Improvement

Measure, iterate, and execute. "You can't improve what you don't measure." - [Jeff](https://www.recode.net/2016/8/5/12377644/technology-startup-investment-advice-scale-slower)

## 3. Customer Success

This value drives everything we do: Help our customer succeed.
