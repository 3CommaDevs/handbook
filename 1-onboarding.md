## Welcome to Pinpoint

Hey! Welcome to the Pinpoint team, we’re so excited to have you with us! We’re hoping you’re going to learn a lot working here and that we’ll learn a lot from you. But first, this document will help you start figuring out how Pinpoint works and how we work together.

To start, you're going to want to make sure you review [Our Mission and Values](https://github.com/pinpt/handbook/blob/master/0-introduction.md) and we're sure you going to want to know all about the [Benefits & Perks](https://github.com/pinpt/handbook/blob/master/2-benefits.md). 

You'll probably have questions so feel free to ping anyone on the team, drop a note in Slack {**#OrgDev**) or if you need anything specific, ping @John!

#### Your First Day

At this point you should have been fully onboarded via Gusto (review [benefits](https://github.com/pinpt/handbook/blob/master/2-benefits.md)) and you should provide your documents for the I-9 filing.

If you need any gear please ping one of the founders and we'll get it sorted! We want you to feel comfortable and have everything you need to be a success!

We currently use a number of different services to get our work done, including:

1. Google Apps for Email
2. Slack for Communication
3. Gusto for Payroll
4. GitHub for Development

It's possible that you've already been granted access but if you're missing something critical to your work then please make sure to get access today! The first day can be overwhelming so we want to make sure you have everything you need, especially the right tools.

Spend time saying "Hi" to your team via Slack or around the office. We're still very small so you'll get to know everyone pretty quickly and **we believe that the entire team is responsible for successful onboarding** so we're here to help and support you!

If we can, we'll go out to lunch - make sure we're aware of your food preferences or restrictions!

Remember, there's a lot of work to be done but it doesn't have to be completed on the first day! This is going to be great and we're so glad you've chosen to be part of the Pinpoint story!
