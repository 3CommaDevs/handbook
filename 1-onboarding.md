## Welcome to Pinpoint

Hey! Welcome to the Pinpoint team, we’re so excited to have you with us! We’re hoping you’re going to learn a lot working here and that we’ll learn a lot from you. But first, this document will help you start figuring out how Pinpoint works and how we work together.

To start, you're going to want to make sure you review [Our Mission and Values](https://github.com/pinpt/handbook/blob/master/0-introduction.md) and we're sure you going to want to know all about the [Benefits & Perks](https://github.com/pinpt/handbook/blob/master/2-benefits.md). 

You'll probably have questions so feel free to ping anyone on the team, drop a note in Slack {**#OrgDev**) or if you need anything specific, ping @John!

#### Your First Day

At this point you should have been fully onboarded via Gusto (review [benefits](https://github.com/pinpt/handbook/blob/master/2-benefits.md)) and you should provide your documents for the I-9 filing.

If you need any gear please ping one of the founders and we'll get it sorted! We want you to feel comfortable and have everything you need to be a success!

We currently use a number of different services to get our work done, including:

1. Google Apps for Email
2. Slack for Communication
3. Gusto for Payroll
4. GitHub for Development

It's possible that you've already been granted access but if you're missing something critical to your work then please make sure to get access today! The first day can be overwhelming so we want to make sure you have everything you need, especially the right tools.

Spend time saying "Hi" to your team via Slack or around the office. We're still very small so you'll get to know everyone pretty quickly and **we believe that the entire team is responsible for successful onboarding** so we're here to help and support you!

If we can, we'll go out to lunch - make sure we're aware of your food preferences or restrictions!

Remember, there's a lot of work to be done but it doesn't have to be completed on the first day! This is going to be great and we're so glad you've chosen to be part of the Pinpoint story!

## Direct Reports

Everyone who works at Pinpoint should report to @Jeff, @Nolan, or @John. The goal of this relationship is to provide support and guidance to the employee -- this is the person they will talk to about their goals, meet with regularly, and go to first with questions. We are not doing any official performance reviews yet, but this is also the relationship where employees will get feedback on how they are doing and areas where they can improve.

These relationships are one to one and are not meant to divide the company into teams. Though we certainly have distinct business functions, we should all try to operate as a single unit wherever possible. At this size, Pinpoint’s organization doesn’t need to go any deeper than this first level, so everyone should feel as if they are on even footing.

## One on Ones

Every week, every member of the Pinpoint team meets with their manager in an open ended meeting that lasts at least thirty minutes. The agenda for the one on one is set by the employee and its primary intention is to build a trusting relationship. 

This is not a status check-up or performance evaluation, it’s dedicated time where the manager is available to hear what each member of their team is excited or frustrated about, what is blocking or scaring them, and what’s going well or could use improvement.

Trust is the fundamental currency of teams, and these meetings are the easiest place to earn trust. Managers are making time for every direct report, every week, so that they build an individual relationship with each one and establish a reliable channel for communication.

We're going to do our best to schedule a recurring calendar event at the same time every week. The schedule is meant to be regular but not rigid and we can all be accomodating as needed.

The agenda can vary widely but this is the team member's meeting, so they should have ultimate control. It's a safe place to listen and to understand about problems, blockers, and to talk through solutions. It's also a place to grow, to receive feedback, and to dig deeper relationally, on both sides of the table!
